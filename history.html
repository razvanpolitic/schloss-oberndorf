        The origin of Oberndorf Castle lies in the darkness of history...
        <br><br>What is certain, however, is that it was the ancestral home of the Marshals of Oberndorf, first
        mentioned in
        a document in 1342.

                <br><br>
                <p>in 1533 the last Marshal of Oberndorf sold the castle to Raymund Fugger from the rich Fugger von der
                    Lilie family of merchants, which was very successful and influential in the 16th century. </p>

                <p>However, the existing castle did not suit the Fuggers, so after a few years, Raymund’s brother Anton,
                    considered the "Prince of Merchants", had a new one built, which was described as a "magnificent
                    nobleman's residence". </p>

                <p>The moated country palace, surrounded by lush forests, had four wings, forming a beautiful courtyard.
                    The gables and the graceful towers were reminiscent of the imperial city architecture of the old
                    Augsburg town hall. Its symmetry and layout as a whole showed a certain generosity, which was
                    entirely appropriate to the imperial dignity of the Fugger family. </p>

                <p>However, the splendor did not last long. During the Thirty Years' War, 1618 to 1648, the castle, in
                    which
                    the Swedes took up quarters, burned down to a large extent - only two wings of the old castle
                    remained.

                <p>After the massive destruction, the castle fell into a deep slumber until it was kissed awake in 1819.
                    The
                    moat was filled in and ruins were removed down to the foundation walls that still exist today.
                    <br><br>
                    Now, the castle stands with a new purpose – joining newlyweds together before their happily ever
                    after.
